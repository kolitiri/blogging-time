My name is Chris!

I am software engineer focused primarily on Python and I like building stuff on my spare time..

During my professional career all these years I noticed that I particulary enjoy writting documentation, so I thought I should give blogging a chance.

I've created this blog to share some thoughts and hopefully engage with developers that share the same interests.

Special thanks to Cotes Chung [cotes2020](https://github.com/cotes2020) for this awesome Jekyll theme!
